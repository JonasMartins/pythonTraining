Ensemble design: In this design, results from oﬀ-the-shelf algorithms are combined into a single and 
more robust output. For example, one might combine the rating outputs from a content-based and a 
collaborative recommender into a single output. A signiﬁcant variation exists in terms of the speciﬁc 
methodologies used for the combination process. The basic principle at work is not very diﬀerent from 
the design of ensemble methods in many data mining applications such as clustering, classiﬁcation, and 
outlier analysis.
